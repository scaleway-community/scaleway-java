# Official Java image on Scaleway

Scripts to build the official Java image on Scaleway

This image is built using [Image Tools](https://github.com/scaleway/image-tools) and depends on the official [Ubuntu](https://github.com/scaleway/image-ubuntu) image.

**This image is meant to be used on a C1 server.**

We use the Docker's building system and convert it at the end to a disk image that will boot on real servers without Docker. Note that the image is still runnable as a Docker container for debug or for inheritance.
